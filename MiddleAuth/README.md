MiddleAuth Prototype:

To start the server, run sudo python server.py YOUR_SERVER_IP. 
You can host the server on either localhost or any publicly 
accessible IPs. 


Then the server is accessible by http://YOUR_SERVER_IP on 
browser. 

We do provide a client script (redirect.py) to connect 
to the server. It is possible to specify the source address 
in the script. If the source address is correct, the script 
will print 'Your source address has been verified!'. 
Otherwise, it will print the source address is not correct.
